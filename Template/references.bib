abstract = {Vortex detection methods help researchers to better understand the potential flow mechanism, and can be divided into three groups. Global methods have higher accuracy at the expense of time performance, while local methods provide results rapidly with poor accuracy. Machine learning-based methods consider both computational speed and accuracy, but their generalization and scalability are poor, which prevents them from being applied to real scenes. To address the above issues, we propose a novel vortex detection method, termed Vortex-U-Net. Our method has three characteristics. Firstly, our approach combines the characteristics of both global and local vortex detection methods. Secondly, it adopts the vorticity field, which integrates the velocity field and coordinates of grid points as the input. In this manner, it can keep more physical grid information of flow fields, which further improves the accuracy and generalization. Thirdly, our method fusions the properties of flow fields into the design of the loss function of the network. The proposed Vortex-U-Net model is subsequently evaluated against several widely used vortex detection methods on both numerically-simulated and analytical flows. Results reveal that our approach can achieve both high accuracy and performance.}

abstract={Vortex identification methods have been extensively studied in recent years due to their importance in understanding the potential physical mechanism of the flow field. Although demonstrating great success in various scenarios, these methods cannot achieve a compromise between computational speed and accuracy, which restricts their usage in large-scale applications. In specific, local methods provide results rapidly with pool accuracies. By contrast, global methods can obtain reliable results by consuming much more time. To take the advantages of both local and global methods, several methods based on convolutional neural networks are proposed. These methods use local patches around each point and the labels obtained by global methods to train the network. They convert the vortex identification tasks into binary classification problems. In this manner, these methods detect vortices rapidly and robustly. By revisiting these methods, we observe two drawbacks that limit their performance: (i) the large number of parameters and (ii) high computational complexity. To address these issues, we provide a rapid vortex identification method by using a fully convolutional segmentation network in this work. Specifically, we discard the fully connected layers to decrease the number of parameters and design a segmentation network to reduce computational complexity. Intensive experimental results show that the accuracy and recall performance of our method are comparable with those of the global methods. Moreover, the time consumption of our method is less than that of all other methods.},
